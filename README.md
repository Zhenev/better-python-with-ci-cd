## Better [Python] Code With CI/CD

This is a repository that accompanies my "Data Scientist Joining CI/CD party" blog series. In part 1 of it, I describe how I set up a continuous integration / continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub.

Two people are the source of inspiration to this post:

1. Our Backend and DevOps Team Lead at factoree.ai, [Uriah Ossin](https://il.linkedin.com/in/uriah-ossin-1935744).
2. [Oleg Polivin](https://github.com/olegpolivin) and his article at DataTalks.Club, [A practical guide for better-looking python code](https://datatalks.club/blog/practical-guide-better-code.html).

## Better [Python] Code With CI/CD

This is a repository that started with my "Data Scientist Joining CI/CD party" blog series. In part 1 of it, I walked the reader through the basics of version control and dependency management. In part 2, I showed how a continuous integration / continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline can be set up using GitHub. I also guided the reader through a specific use case that involves automated failure of a pull request check triggered by the absence of a version update.

Two people were the source of inspiration to that one:

1. Our Backend and DevOps Team Lead at factoree.ai, [Uriah Ossin](https://il.linkedin.com/in/uriah-ossin-1935744).
2. [Oleg Polivin](https://github.com/olegpolivin) and his article at DataTalks.Club, [A practical guide for better-looking python code](https://datatalks.club/blog/practical-guide-better-code.html).

There are many others, whose work inspires me too and I continue adding other projects to this repository.
